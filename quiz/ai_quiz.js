    "answer": "Boosting focuses on difficult cases, bagging averages over many models",
    "justification": "Bagging builds models independently and averages their output, while boosting builds sequentially, correcting prior errors."

    "question": "What does 'early stopping' do during training?",
    "choices": [
      "Speeds up model convergence",
      "Prevents the model from learning too fast",
      "Halts training when validation performance stops improving",
      "Increases regularization strength"
    ],
    "answer": "Halts training when validation performance stops improving",
    "justification": "Early stopping prevents overfitting by stopping training when performance on the validation set no longer improves."
